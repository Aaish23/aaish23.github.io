			<p>Hi there! My name is Aaisha Shafique and I am a recent graduate from the Digital Enterprise Management program at University of Toronto Mississauga. I believe my unique view on the world can bring any company a different vibe and skills which can help in reaching the organization's goals. Being brought up in three different countries, I have the ability to understand various cultures and give customers what they need. I have experience in web designing, marketing, and event planning. I possess leadership, social, and organizational skills. I am fluent in both English and Urdu.</p>
			<p>As an art and communication student, I always need some sort of inspiration for my work. I receive this inspiration from the music I listen to and the environment around me. My favorite artist once said "don't be trapped in someone's else's dream" and I take this quote as inspiration to improve myself in all aspects and establish my own dream: to create commercials which inspire others the way that artist inspired me.</p>
