					<div class="overlay-text"> Carrot Rewards Communication Plan was a final group project for my Marketing Strategies class in third year. Carrot Rewards is B-corp fitness app that uses rewards to incentivize exercise amongst Canadians. Their goal is to help reduce obesity rates in the long run. However, there were many problems with this application and our final project focused on suggesting ways to improve the app itself and its marketing techniques. </div>

					<div class="overlay-text"> UnivJobs is a startup company that my group and I worked with for our Online Marketing and Advertising class. UnivJobs is an online marketplace for students, recent graduates, and employers, where students can gain experience and land potential full-time jobs after graduation. Its founder, Charles Javelona, requested we work with him in coming up with a strategy that can organically increase the site's subscribers and visitors, without having to use promoted material. The final result was a carefully crafted campaign that utilized the company's social media pages by promoting through relevant content key to the targeted audience.</div>

					<div class="overlay-text"> Kim's Convenience is a well known Canadian TV series by CBC Television. The show follows the everyday lives of the Kim family - Appa, Umma, Jung, and Janet. My first year communications professor set up the premise of the assignment by pretending the second season of the show was cancelled and the producers were going to have a web series instead. We were to work in groups and take the producers as our client to come up with a social media campaign that would promote the web series. This campaign included everything from goal establishment to content creation and advertising. The logo on the title page is something I designed myself for the series promotion.</div>

					<div class="overlay-text"> My second year illustrator design class had an assignment in which we were to choose a board game and redesign it integrating the basic design principles and design process steps - define, ideate, analyze, select, implement, and evaluate. Global Survival is the worst rated board game and I took up the challenge to redesign the board as well as the whole game - I inetegrated VR into the board game to make it more appealing and educational. Refer to pages 9 and 10 for pictures of the game board and die.</div>

					<div class="overlay-text"> In my fourth year design class we were to come up with a product that could be helpful to people and utilize some of the ten faces of innovation along with creating a marketing metadesign and designing the packaging. This is a product I came up with from personal exeperience. Part of this assignment was to create a 15 second storyboard as well, however since this is a pdf version, the video cannot be viewed.</div>
